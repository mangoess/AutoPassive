# WHAT IS THIS?
Autopassive was originally a personal project, I had a time cooldown for a discord bot and when I could claim my prizes was at 3AM, I wasn't going to wait it so I made this application

# WHY ARE YOU PUTTING IT HERE NOW?
idk if something ever happens I wanna make sure stuff like this doesn't get lost due time

# CAN I USE THIS?
Sure! but if you fork this repository or copy the code of it, please give me credit, or else...
(ok that was a joke but if you use my code or fork my repository without substantial credit I am entitled to take action, this is my work and if you misuse it you'll have to delete the parts with my code included)
